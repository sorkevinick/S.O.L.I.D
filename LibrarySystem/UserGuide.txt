Library Management System with SOLID Principles

Objective:
The project demonstrates the application of SOLID principles in a library management system, focusing on modular, extensible, and maintainable code.

Principles and Refactoring Justifications:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
- Each class has a single responsibility.
- BorrowService manages borrowing logic, BookRepository handles book data, and SessionManager manages sessions.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
- Interfaces for repository and service classes allow extension without modification.
- New book types or session storage methods can be added without altering existing classes.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
- The interfaces allow implementing new repositories or session managers without altering existing code.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
- Each interface provides only relevant methods, avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
- BorrowService relies on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

Execution:
1. Install dependencies with Composer:
   composer dump-autoload
2. Access the system via index.php to test book borrowing and returning functionality.
